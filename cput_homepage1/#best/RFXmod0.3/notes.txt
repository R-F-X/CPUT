<!--
This award winning website was made with LOVE by CPUT's Web Office in 2013. 
Ashley Jones, Marick Hornsveld and Lovemore Nalube. 
Sadly, Ashley passed away in 2016. Here is our dedication to him: 

"Ashley Jones encountered an unhandled exception in his core operating system, 
which prematurely triggered a critical 'STOP' condition October 2016. 
Diagnostics indicated multiple cascading hardware failures as the root problem. 
Though his hardware has been decommissioned, Ashley's application has been 
migrated to the Cloud and has been repurposed to run in a virtual machine on an infinite loop, 
System.exit"
